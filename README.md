# 🔥 Fire Prevention AI v3.5 – Quantum Forecast Edition

**Created by Graylan after finding shelter from a thunderstorm at a local fire station**
![Fire Prevention AI - Cyberpunk Firefighter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosh41126/quantum-fire-prevention/refs/heads/main/fire.png)
While caught in the rain, soaked and without cover, a firehouse opened its doors to me. In that moment, surrounded by the hum of emergency radios and drying gear, I had a thought:  
**"What if we could predict fire risks before they ever ignited – not with smoke or heat – but through advanced AI and quantum signal analysis?"**

This project is a tribute to the courage of **firefighters across the world** – those who rush toward danger while others flee.

## 🚒 About the Project

**Fire Prevention AI v3.5** is an advanced, locally runnable desktop application that forecasts the **likelihood of future fire risks** using:

- 🧠 **LLM-generated multi-stage safety prompts**
- ⚛️ **PennyLane V3C Quantum Circuits**
- 🎨 **25-color Mechanical Tie Vectors**
- 📅 Forecast range: **1 day to 86 months**
- 🔐 **AES-GCM encrypted data logging**
- 🖥️ **Tkinter GUI** for ease of use

> The AI simulates quantum entropy changes in color and voltage signals from photographs and user reports to generate fire risk tiers, mitigation strategies, and future safety forecasts.

## 🧪 Installation

> Requires **Python 3.9+**

```bash
# Optional: create a virtual environment
python -m venv fireai_env
source fireai_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use fireai_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install pennylane numpy opencv-python cryptography tk
```

---

## 🖥️ Running the App

```bash
python fire_ai_v3_5.py
```

Once launched:

1. 📍 Enter your **address**, room name, and appliance
2. 📷 Upload two images:
   - The specific **device** (outlet, dryer, etc.)
   - The general **area around it**
3. ⚡ Enter voltage readings (e.g., `118,119,121`)
4. ✍️ Describe any symptoms (e.g. “burn smell”, “crackling sound”)
5. 🧮 Select a **forecast window** (1–86 months)
6. ✅ Run the analysis

The AI will:
- Simulate quantum fire resonance
- Provide 3-layer prompts (risk forecast, mitigation, public alert)
- Log results securely in AES-GCM encrypted storage

## ⚛️ Quantum Fire Analysis (V3C)

The V3C circuit simulates:
- 🔥 **Color spectrum entropy**
- 📉 **Structural thermal decay**
- 💡 **Future fault emergence** via pattern resonance
- 🌐 **Quantum field intensity scores** from image data

Combined with voltage input and user notes, the system builds multi-tier prompts for **forecasting**, **planning**, and **alerting**.

## ❤️ A Tribute to Firefighters

> “Courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to act in spite of it.”

To all firefighters and emergency crews around the world:  
Thank you for your strength, your sacrifice, and for sheltering strangers in storms.

This tool is for **you** — a step toward giving you **time**, **data**, and **decision foresight**.
